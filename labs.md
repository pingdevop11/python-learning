Test each of the two functions with a variety of inputs to ensure they return the correct result. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it performs the correct conversion and prints the correct result.

## Exercise 4. Word count
### Exercise goal
Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `word_count.py`. In the file, define a function called `count_words`. The function should take one argument (the sentence to count words in) and return the number of words in the sentence. In the main part of the program, prompt the user to enter a sentence and call the `count_words` function. Print the number of words to the console.
### Self test instructions
Test the `count_words` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it returns the correct result. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it counts the words correctly and prints the correct result.

## Exercise 5. Guess the number
### Exercise goal
Write a program that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess the number.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `guess_the_number.py`. In the file, use the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 100. Prompt the user to guess the number and provide feedback (higher or lower) until the user guesses the correct number. Print the number of guesses it took the user to guess the number.
### Self test instructions
Test the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it generates a new random number each time and provides accurate feedback to the user.

## Exercise 6. Factorial calculator
### Exercise goal
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `factorial.py`. In the file, define a function called `factorial`. The function should take one argument (the number to calculate the factorial of) and return the factorial of that number. In the main part of the program, prompt the user to enter a number and call the `factorial` function. Print the factorial to the console.
### Self test instructions
Test the `factorial` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it returns the correct result. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it calculates the factorial correctly and prints the correct result.

## Exercise 7. Palindrome checker
### Exercise goal
Write a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `palindrome.py`. In the file, define a function called `is_palindrome`. The function should take one argument (the word to check) and return `True` if the word is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. In the main part of the program, prompt the user to enter a word and call the `is_palindrome` function. Print whether the word is a palindrome or not to the console.
### Self test instructions
Test the `is_palindrome` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it returns the correct result. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it checks if the word is a palindrome correctly and prints the correct result.

## Exercise 8. File reader
### Exercise goal
Write a program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `file_reader.py`. In the file, define a function called `read_file`. The function should take one argument (the file name) and print the contents of the file to the console. In the main part of the program, prompt the user to enter a file name and call the `read_file` function.
### Self test instructions
Test the `read_file` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it prints the correct contents of the file to the console. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it prompts the user for a file name and calls the `read_file` function correctly.

## Exercise 9. List sorter
### Exercise goal
Write a program that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `list_sorter.py`. In the file, define a function called `sort_list`. The function should take one argument (the list of numbers to sort) and return the sorted list. In the main part of the program, prompt the user to enter a list of numbers (comma-separated) and call the `sort_list` function. Print the sorted list to the console.
### Self test instructions
Test the `sort_list` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it returns the correct sorted list. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it prompts the user for a list of numbers correctly and calls the `sort_list` function correctly.

## Exercise 10. Dictionary searcher
### Exercise goal
Write a program that searches a dictionary for a given key and returns its value.
### Instructions
Create a new file called `dictionary_searcher.py`. In the file, define a dictionary with at least five key-value pairs. Define a function called `search_dictionary`. The function should take two arguments (the dictionary to search and the key to search for) and return the value associated with the key. In the main part of the program, prompt the user to enter a key and call the `search_dictionary` function. Print the value associated with the key to the console.
### Self test instructions
Test the `search_dictionary` function with a variety of inputs to ensure it returns the correct value associated with the key. Test the main part of the program with a variety of inputs to ensure it prompts the user for a key correctly and calls the `search_dictionary` function correctly.
